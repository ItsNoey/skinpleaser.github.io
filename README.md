As I'm beginning my learning journey again, I want to spend more time with HTML and CSS (with some of JS magic) by creating a website on something that I'm passionate about, skincare.

I'm having so much fun finding inspiration and designing all the while learning about HTML and CSS (mainly).

This is only a static web page at the moment. I plan to keep adding and fixing this project while I'm accumulating my knowledge. 

Thanks for visiting!
